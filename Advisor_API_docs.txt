b. There is no need to make the UI or any pages for this. We only need the APIs
to perform the above functions as our internal team is decoupled into backend
and frontend roles, and you’ll be only working on the backend side
2. Add the dummy data to test the APIs accordingly
3. Take the necessary assumptions from your end to complete the above APIs
4. Put this code in a public repo on Github
5. Deploy the above-made code base on Heroku on a free tier server
6. You can test your APIs using Postman
7. If you don’t know any concept or part of this, try to learn things from the numerous
tutorials available online. Learning things on the go and just enough to get the job
done is a highly coveted skill in this industry.
8. No doubts will be entertained regarding this test. That being said, partial submissions
are better than no submissions.
9. Structure your submission like this and send it to tech@nurturelabs.co with the
subject “Backend Dev Application”.
a. Your Name
b. The location you’re currently at
c. Github link to the code base for this submission
d. Heroku Deployment Link
e. Postman link to import collection (optional)
f. Specify the earliest date you can join if you do get selected. We’ll need you to
work for at least 9 hrs a day from Monday to Friday, so apply only provided
you are available for the mentioned number of hours.
g. Attach your resume(PDF file) or link to your updated LinkedIn profile
General Advice
If you think all of this is very daunting or unfair to expect from a fresher please read this.
We are currently looking for someone who has built at least one small project by themselves
as a learning exercise. Everything we have asked for is easily available in the form of
tutorials and Youtube videos. Even if you join a company they'll point you towards those
resources and ask you to self-learn using them, the only thing extra you’ll have is some
direction and focus where they’ll tell you exactly what to learn. You can initially find this focus
by deciding on the path by reading about different technologies and trying out more and
more mini projects yourself. Please take this decision on your own rather than have
someone just give you a “job” and decide this for yourself. Your next 30-year career depends
on it. We are looking for people who have taken the decision to walk on this path and put in
the effort to teach themselves. It’s never too late to start.
